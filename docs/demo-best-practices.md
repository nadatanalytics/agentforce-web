## 📝 Writing Style Guidelines

### 1. Professional Yet Approachable

**Do:**
- "I can help you understand what caused the increase"
- "Let me analyze your energy usage pattern"
- "Here's what I found in your account"

**Don't:**
- "There might be some issues"
- "I think your bill is high"
- "You probably used more energy"

### 2. Specific and Quantified

**Do:**
- "Your usage increased by 102% due to 18 cold days below 5°C"
- "This represents an additional £90 in weather-related costs"
- "You can save 15-20% with these three changes"

**Don't:**
- "Your usage went up because of cold weather"
- "This cost you extra money"
- "You can save some money"

### 3. Action-Oriented Language

**Do:**
- "Here are three immediate steps you can take"
- "I'll help you set up a payment plan today"
- "Let me schedule a free energy audit for you"

**Don't:**
- "You might want to consider making changes"
- "There are options available"
- "You could look into getting help"
