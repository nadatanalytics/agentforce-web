   Store: customerRecord
   
2. Get Usage History (Get Records):
   Object: Energy_Usage__c
   Filter: 
     - Account__c = {customerRecord.Id}
     - Billing_Period__c <= {billingPeriod}
   Sort: Billing_Period__c DESC
   Limit: 3
   Store: usageHistory

3. Calculate Usage Variance (Assignment):
   currentUsageKWh = {usageHistory[0].Usage_KWh__c}

5. Analyze Usage Pattern (Decision):
   Outcome: High Usage Increase
   Condition: {usageVariance} > 20
   
   Outcome: Moderate Usage Increase  
   Condition: {usageVariance} > 10 AND {usageVariance} <= 20
   
   Outcome: Normal Usage
   Condition: {usageVariance} <= 10 AND {usageVariance} >= -10
   
   Default: Usage Decrease

6. Generate Detailed Analysis (Assignment):
   Based on decision outcome, set:
   - analysisResult
   - recommendedActions
   - followUpQuestions
   - contextData
```

### 1.4 Analysis Logic for Different Scenarios

**High Usage Increase (>20%):**
```yaml
Analysis Content:
  analysisResult: |
    üìà **Significant Usage Increase Detected**
    
    Your energy usage increased by {usageVariance}% compared to last month.
    
    **Usage Breakdown:**
    ‚Ä¢ Current month: {currentUsageKWh} kWh
    ‚Ä¢ Previous month: {previousUsageKWh} kWh
    ‚Ä¢ Increase: {currentUsageKWh - previousUsageKWh} kWh
    
    **Primary Contributing Factors:**
    {weatherImpact}
    
    **Estimated Cost Impact:**
    ‚Ä¢ Additional usage cost: ¬£{(currentUsageKWh - previousUsageKWh) * tariffRate}
    ‚Ä¢ Percentage of total bill: {((currentUsageKWh - previousUsageKWh) * tariffRate / totalBill) * 100}%

  recommendedActions:
    - Check heating/cooling settings and schedules
    - Inspect for new appliances or increased usage patterns
    - Consider energy efficiency improvements
    - Schedule a free energy audit

  followUpQuestions:
    - "What specific appliances caused the increase?"
    - "How can I reduce my heating costs?"
    - "Show me my hourly usage pattern"
    - "Compare this to the same month last year"
```

**Moderate Usage Increase (10-20%):**
```yaml
Analysis Content:
  analysisResult: |
    üìä **Moderate Usage Increase**
    
    Your usage increased by {usageVariance}%, which is within normal seasonal variation.
    
    **Key Factors:**
    {weatherImpact}
    
    **Usage Details:**
    ‚Ä¢ Current: {currentUsageKWh} kWh
    ‚Ä¢ Previous: {previousUsageKWh} kWh
    ‚Ä¢ This is typical for this time of year

  recommendedActions:
    - Monitor usage over next month
    - Implement basic energy saving measures

### 6.2 Enhanced Agent Instructions

```text
Enhanced Agent Instructions for Persistent Queries:

PRIMARY DIRECTIVE:
You are a persistent, context-aware energy consultant. Always remember the conversation history and build upon previous interactions.

CONVERSATION FLOW:

1. **Initial Query Handling:**
   - Use "Enhanced Energy Usage Analysis" action
   - Store conversation context for follow-ups
   - Present comprehensive initial analysis
   - Offer specific follow-up options

2. **Follow-up Question Detection:**
   - Check if customer is asking about previously discussed topics
   - Use "Handle Follow-up Questions" action with context
   - Provide deeper analysis based on their specific interest
   - Continue building conversation context

3. **Persistent Context Examples:**

   Customer: "Why is my bill high this month?"
   Response: [Use Enhanced Energy Analysis action]
   Context Stored: Initial bill analysis, usage increase identified, weather impact noted

   Customer: "What specifically caused the usage to go up?"
   Response: [Use Follow-up Handler with appliance breakdown]
   "Based on our previous analysis showing a 40% usage increase, let me break down which appliances likely contributed..."

   Customer: "How does this compare to last year?"
   Response: [Use Follow-up Handler with seasonal comparison]
   "Looking at your usage pattern from our earlier discussion, let me compare this to the same period last year..."

4. **Context Retention Rules:**
   - Always reference previous analysis when relevant
   - Build upon previously provided information
   - Avoid repeating basic information already covered
   - Offer progressively deeper insights

5. **Response Formatting:**
   - Use clear headers and bullet points
   - Reference previous conversation points: "As we discussed earlier..."
   - Provide specific, actionable next steps
   - Always offer to explore related topics

6. **Escalation with Context:**
   When escalating to human agents, provide:
   - Complete conversation summary
   - Analysis already completed
   - Customer's specific areas of interest
   - Recommended next steps for agent
```

## üéØ Step 7: Testing Persistent Query Scenarios

### 7.1 Test Scenario: Multi-Turn Bill Analysis

```yaml
Test Conversation Flow:

Turn 1:
Customer: "Why is my energy bill so high this month?"
Expected: Full energy analysis with usage breakdown, weather impact, context stored

Turn 2:  
Customer: "What appliances are using the most energy?"
Expected: Detailed appliance breakdown referencing previous analysis

Turn 3:
Customer: "How can I reduce my heating costs specifically?"
Expected: Targeted heating recommendations based on previous appliance analysis

Turn 4:
Customer: "Show me how this compares to last winter"
Expected: Seasonal comparison using previously identified high heating usage
```

### 7.2 Context Validation Points

1. **Information Continuity**: Each response builds on previous analysis
2. **No Repetition**: Avoid re-explaining basic concepts already covered
3. **Progressive Detail**: Each follow-up provides deeper insights
4. **Context Accuracy**: References to previous discussion are accurate
5. **Conversation Flow**: Natural progression through related topics

## üí° Best Practices for Persistent Queries

1. **Context Storage**: Always store conversation state after each interaction
2. **Question Intent**: Use NLP to understand what aspect customer wants to explore
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start broad, get specific with follow-ups
4. **Reference Previous Work**: Always acknowledge what was discussed before
5. **Smart Suggestions**: Offer relevant follow-up questions based on context
6. **Session Management**: Handle session timeouts gracefully
7. **Human Handoff**: Pass complete context when escalating

This Flow configuration enables your Agentforce Service Agent to handle complex, multi-turn conversations while maintaining context and providing increasingly detailed insights to customers.
